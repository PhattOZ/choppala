Inspired from Shopee, we wanted to apply topics we self-learned during our summer break which is under the covid-19 lockdown including Next.js, Express client-server-side responsibilities to create our first fully functional web application.

We learned a lot. The project widens our knowledge about the application development life cycle and we're fully aware that there's a lot of room for improvement which we will address in our next project.
